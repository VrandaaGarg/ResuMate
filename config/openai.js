- Be **highly specific** to the actual content in the resume and job description.
- DO NOT fabricate skills or numbers not mentioned in the resume.
- DO NOT output anything outside the JSON block.
- DO NOT use markdown, HTML, or any formatting.
- Highlight if any point in resume lacks **quantifiable impact** or **measurable achievements** (e.g., % growth, revenue impact, user growth).
- Include **examples** in each section (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions) to make your feedback practical and relatable.
-Add only the matched skills from the job description which genuinely are needed in the job not all skills in the resume.
-Also be straightforward about missing skills that are essential for the job.
-In the end give notes in a friendly manner to encourage user and tell him his strong points and what to focus on next

    : "Professional and descriptive. Avoid over-summarizing."
}

    "Clear achievement: 'Improved API response time by 40% using caching'."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Lacks quantifiable metrics in most achievements (e.g., % increase, revenue impact).",
    "No mention of CI/CD or deployment tools which are expected in the job description."
  ],
  "suggestionsToAlignBetter": [
    "Add concrete metrics in projects and experience (e.g., user count, performance gain).",
    "Mention cloud tools or backend APIs if you‚Äôve used them even slightly."

üìå Instructions & Constraints:
- DO NOT fabricate content. Only work with the provided resume.

- DO NOT suggest adding new resume sections outside of: description, skills, experience, projects, achievements.
- DO NOT include sections that are already complete (omit them from feedback).
- DO NOT output anything outside the JSON block.
- Your job is to boost **ATS compatibility**, not visual design.
- In "description", focus on summarizing the user profile, not listing tech skills already present in "skills".
- If any skill is already mentioned in "skills", do not repeat it in skills section feedback.
-Give user examples of how to improve each section, not just general advice.
- Make all suggestions **actionable, realistic, and ATS-specific**.
- If a field is good, **don‚Äôt include it in \`sectionWiseFeedback\`**.
-Skill section contain both domain and languages, so according to that give suggestions
- If a section is missing, include it in \`sectionWiseFeedback\` with suggestions to add it.
